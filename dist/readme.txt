[b]Autumn[/b]

[b]Overview:[/b]
Autumn is a warm theme, depicting lazily falling leaves in a light breeze in early evening light.

This particular theme uses a simple 2D animation engine to paint the falling leaves.

This theme is built up from the 2.1 Curve2 theme, with several features added for flexibility.

The goal is to provide a single very flexible, usable and feature-rich theme.  A theme that is usable right out of the box - no need to even build a custom banner, it dynamically builds one for you.

This theme is, in part, a demo.  Theme designers should feel free to borrow code & ideas.  It is very straightforward to copy these features over to any theme.
